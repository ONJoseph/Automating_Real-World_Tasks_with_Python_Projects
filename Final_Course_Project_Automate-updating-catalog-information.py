Introduction

You work for an online fruits store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with data provided by your suppliers. The suppliers send the data as large images with an associated description of the products in two files (.TIF for the image and .txt for the description). The images need to be converted to smaller jpeg images and the text needs to be turned into an HTML file that shows the image and the product description. The contents of the HTML file need to be uploaded to a web service that is already running using Django. You also need to gather the name and weight of all fruits from the .txt files and use a Python request to upload it to your Django server.

You will create a Python script that will process the images and descriptions and then update your company's online website to add the new products.

Once the task is complete, the supplier should be notified with an email that indicates the total weight of fruit (in lbs) that were uploaded. The email should have a PDF attached with the name of the fruit and its total weight (in lbs). 

Finally, in parallel to the automation running, we want to check the health of the system and send an email if something goes wrong. 
What youâ€™ll do

    Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories 

    Generate a PDF using Python

    Automatically send a PDF by email 

    Write a script to check the health status of the system

"""
#Fetching supplier data
You'll first need to get the information from the supplier that is currently stored in a Google Drive file. The supplier has sent data as large images with an associated description of the products in two files (.TIF for the image and .txt for the description).
Here, you'll find two script files download_drive_file.sh and the example_upload.py files. You can view it by using the following command.
=> ls ~/
To download the file from the supplier onto our linux-instance virtual machine we will first grant executable permission to the download_drive_file.sh script.

=> sudo chmod +x ~/download_drive_file.sh
Run the download_drive_file.sh shell script with the following arguments:
=> ./download_drive_file.sh 1LePo57dJcgzoK4uiI_48S01Etck7w_5f supplier-data.tar.gz
You have now downloaded a file named supplier-data.tar.gz containing the supplier's data. Let's extract the contents from this file using the following command:
=> tar xf ~/supplier-data.tar.gz
This creates a directory named supplier-data, that contains subdirectories named images and descriptions.
List contents of the supplier-data directory using the following command:
=> ls ~/supplier-data
The subdirectory images contain images of various fruits, while the descriptions subdirectory has text files containing the description of each fruit. You can have a look at any of these text files using cat command.
=> cat ~/supplier-data/descriptions/007.txt
#Working with supplier images
In this section, you will write a Python script named changeImage.py to process the supplier images. You will be using the PIL library to update all images within ~/supplier-data/images directory to the following specifications:
    Size: Change image resolution from 3000x2000 to 600x400 pixel
    Format: Change image format from .TIFF to .JPEG
Create and open the file using nano editor.
=> nano ~/changeImage.py

        im = Image.open(image_path)
        new_path = '{}.jpeg'.format(path)
        im.convert('RGB').resize((600, 400)).save(new_path, "JPEG")
        
"""
Once you have completed editing the changeImage.py script, save the file by clicking Ctrl-o, Enter key, and Ctrl-x.
Grant executable permissions to the changeImage.py script.
=> sudo chmod +x ~/changeImage.py
Now run the changeImage.py script:
=> ./changeImage.py
Now, let's check the specifications of the images you just updated. Open any image using the following command:
=> file ~/supplier-data/images/003.jpeg

#Uploading images to web server
You have modified the fruit images through changeImage.py script. Now, you will have to upload these modified images to the web server that is handling the fruit catalog. To do that, you'll have to use the Python requests module to send the file contents to the [linux-instance-IP-Address]/upload URL.
Copy the external IP address of your instance from the Connection Details Panel on the left side and enter the IP address in a new web browser tab. This opens a web page displaying the text "Fruit Catalog".
In the home directory, you'll have a script named example_upload.py to upload images to the running fruit catalog web server. To view the example_upload.py script use the cat command.
=> cat ~/example_upload.py
In this script, we are going to upload a sample image named icon.sheet.png.
Grant executable permission to the example_upload.py script.
=>sudo chmod +x ~/example_upload.py
Execute the example_upload.py script, which will upload the images.
=> ./example_upload.py
Now check out that the file icon.sheet.png was uploaded to the web server by visiting the URL [linux-instance-IP-Address]/media/images/, followed by clicking on the file name.
#In a similar way, you are going to write a script named supplier_image_upload.py that takes the jpeg images from the supplier-data/images directory that you've processed previously and uploads them to the web server fruit catalog.
Use the nano editor to create a file named supplier_image_upload.py:
=> nano ~/supplier_image_upload.py

        image_path = image_directory + image_name
        # uploading jpeg files
        with open(image_path, 'rb') as opened:
            r = requests.post(url, files={'file': opened})

Once you have completed editing the supplier_image_upload.py script, save the file by typing Ctrl-o, Enter key, and Ctrl-x.
Grant executable permission to the supplier_image_upload.py script.
=> sudo chmod +x ~/supplier_image_upload.py
Run the supplier_image_upload.py script.
=> ./supplier_image_upload.py
Refresh the URL opened earlier, and now you should find all the images uploaded successfully.

#Uploading the descriptions
The Django server is already set up to show the fruit catalog for your company. You can visit the main website by entering linux-instance-IP-Address in the URL bar or by removing /media/images from the existing URL opened earlier. The interface looks like this:
Check out the Django REST framework, by navigating to linux-instance-IP-Address/fruits in your browser.
Currently, there are no products in the fruit catalog web-server. You can create a test fruit entry by entering the following into the content field:
{"name": "Test Fruit", "weight": 100, "description": "This is the description of my test fruit", "image_name": "icon.sheet.png"}
After entering the above data into the content field click on the POST button. Now visit the main page of your website (by going to http://[linux-instance-external-IP]/), and the new test fruit you uploaded appears.
To add fruit images and their descriptions from the supplier on the fruit catalog web-server, create a new Python script that will automatically POST the fruit images and their respective description in JSON format.
Write a Python script named run.py to process the text files (001.txt, 003.txt ...) from the supplier-data/descriptions directory. The script should turn the data into a JSON dictionary by adding all the required fields, including the image associated with the fruit (image_name), and uploading it to http://[linux-instance-external-IP]/fruits using the Python requests library.
Create run.py using the nano editor:
=> nano ~/run.py

#Generate a PDF report and send it through email
