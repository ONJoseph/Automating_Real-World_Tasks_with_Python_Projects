# Automating_Real-World_Tasks_with_Python_Projects
You'll be given a bunch of small projects based on real-life scenarios, and you'll use Python to write the automation that will solve the challenges.  Working on these projects will give you the opportunity to start building your programming portfolio. When youâ€™re done with each of them, you can upload the code you write to GitHub to show off your skills!
